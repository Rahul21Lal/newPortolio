                        <p>
                            My name is Rahul Lal and I'm pursuing to be a developer, I also have an interest in front-end development, database development, and UX design. I chose to be a developer because of I like to create, design and build. Also, it suits my technical understanding. I enjoy using computers, and I want a career that revolves around using them.
                            <br><br>
                            Started my third year at Pakuranga College. I was placed into a computing course to fill my timetable. The course consisted of touch-typing, Microsoft office, and HTML. I was mind-blown by the content and decided this will be a great career. I decided to be a developer when I applied for a software diploma at Computer Power Plus.

                            One of the projects I made is a calculator. Based on a calculator I made with Java. This calculator is a Windows universal application, written in C#/XAML, and developed on Visual Studio 2015. I intend to make it a multi-tool application (including the calculator). To look for more projects, visit my portfolio on the link above.

                            Outside my tertiary studies. I'm trained in Goju Ryu Karate where I'm a 1st-degree black belt. Started in 2005 and earned my black belt in 2010. I'm currently focusing on my studies, so will continue karate in the future. I also listen to music and browse the internet.
                            <br><br>
                            Why you should hire me is that I have a practical understanding of programming languages. I'd created projects with Java and C#, relational databases with T-SQL, and websites with HTML/CSS.
