                        <h1>About Myself</h1>
                        <h4>
                             My name is Rahul Lal. I'm pursuing a career as a software developer
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            My career path began in early 2011, the year I started <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ncea/" >NCEA</a> Level 1 at <a href="https://www.pakuranga.school.nz/" target="_blank">Pakuranga College</a>. I was placed in a generic computing course to complete my school timetable. I was amazed by the content that people would think they could do in their sleep. This content consists of touch-typing, understandig the Microsoft Office Suite, and basic HTML and CSS. I continued to take the classes for my last two years of school. That got me to chose to have a career in Information Technology.
                            <br><br>
                            A few months after graduating from college, I started studying the <a href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Diploma in Software Development</a> at <a href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/Diploma-in-Software-Development-Level5.html" target="_blank" >Computer Power Plus</a>. I chose Computer Power Plus as oppose to university, as they focus on skill than academics, self-pace & directed learning as oppose to lectures & labs, and to build on my current skillset at that time. 
                            <br><br>
                            During my time as a Computer Power Plus student, I learned various programming languages from SQL, Java and C#. Other areas such as database development, SDLC, and project management. I also learned things outside of my course, such as dressing to impress, finding direction from expierence (in general), and other tricks that could help impress an employer. I was also out of comfort zone, surrounded with students who are older than me and have expierence.
                            <br><br>
                            By late July, I had completed my diploma. I didn't decided not to find work immediately, not before I gain some work expierence. As a ex-school graduate who completed a IT diploma, finding work will be a drag. So gaining prior expierence would expose me to the real-world enviroment, expand my skills, connect with other in industry. On my last attempt, I didn't have enough skills to be exposed to real-world expierence. So I chose to continue study.
                            <br><br>
                            On early April, I started studying the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5637e700e4b0c91b095e8627/t/56afd3c6b09f95166bbc125b/1454363591703/AMES+Diploma+in+Distributed+Software+Development.pdf" target="_blank">Diploma in Distributed Software Development</a> at <a href="http://www.ames.ac.nz/" target="_blank" >AMES IT</a>.
