                        <p>
                            My name is Rahul Lal, and I want to become a software developer. For a career, I chose software development as a perfect medium to express my passion for creating. I have practical skills in HTML, C#, Java, and SQL/TSQL. I&rsquo;m currently studying at AMES IT, studying the Diploma in Distributed Software Development. Previously I&rsquo;d completed the Diploma in Software Development at Computer Power Plus.
