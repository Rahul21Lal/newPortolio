                        <h4>
                            My name is Rahul Lal. I'm pursuing a career as a software developer

                            My career path began in early 2011, the year I started <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ncea/">NCEA</a> Level 1 at <a href="https://www.pakuranga.school.nz/">Pakuranga College</a>. I was placed in a generic computing course to complete my school timetable. I was amazed by the content that people would think they could do in their sleep. This content consists of touch-typing, understandig the Microsoft Office Suite, and basic HTML and CSS. I continued to take the classes for my last two years of school. That got me to chose to have a career in Information Technology.
                            <br><br>
                            A few months after graduating from college, I started studying the <a href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/">Diploma in Software Development</a> at <a href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/Diploma-in-Software-Development-Level5.html">Computer Power Plus</a>. I chose Computer Power Plus as oppose to university, as they focus on skill than academics, self-pace & directed learning as oppose to lectures & labs, and to build on my current skillset at that time.
