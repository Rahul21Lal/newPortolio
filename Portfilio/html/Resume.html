                        <p>
                            During my secondary studies ,  I have created a website for the Pakuranga Karate Club (dummy club) .  I used Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) & Cascade Style Sheet (CSS) as the languages, I used Sharepoint Designer as the IDE

                            Whilst studying at Computer Power Plus I have created a scientific calculator for the Programming Concepts module. Java was the language used for this module
                            As part of the Microsoft Student Accelerator, I was tasked to create an app. My app was a calculator, based on a project I did at Computer Power Plus. This was made using C# and developed it on the 2015​ version of Visual Studio

                        <h4>Skills for database development</h4>
                        <p>
                        I have created a database system using Microsoft Access as part of my studies at Computer Power Plus 
                        Programming knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL)
                        <br><br>
                        My first industry project at AMES IT is a relational database management system (RDBMS)  for McDanny, a fictitious fast food restaurant. I’d create the database using Transact-Structured Query Language (TSQL),  a programming language use to manage the data inside the DBMS, this is also an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) from Microsoft. The integrated development environment (The software of the data creation) used was SQL Server Management Studio 2014, also used Visual Studio Data Tools to create multiple SSIS Packages.
